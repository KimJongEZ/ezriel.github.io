      <p>
        Ezriel Bornea is a full-time student at San Jose State University. He’s
        pursuing his bachelor’s degree in business with a concentration in
        management information systems. He’s a first generation immigrant
        college student and intends to enter the tech industry after graduation.
        Ezriel works in collaborative environments to enhance his professional
        skills. He’s employed in a retail position for a national outdoor and
        conservation company, he volunteers for his local church organization
        and is involved with the management information systems association.
        These experiences have provided him with skills in time management,
        collaboration and a strong work ethic. Ezriel intends for these skills
        to help prepare him for his life after college. Outside of work
        and school, Ezriel’s interests include going to the gym and traveling.
        He believes that spending time away from home is a good way to open
        oneself up to new perspectives. He routinely works out and believes that
        having discipline is a good way to stay focused on his goals.
